Embark on a 7-day journey into the world of Python for Data Science. This beginner-friendly course introduces you to the fundamental concepts and tools needed to work with data efficiently. Explore Python's syntax, data types, and libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation. Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization using Matplotlib, and essential data analysis techniques. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to load, clean, analyze, and visualize data, setting a solid foundation for your data science journey.

# Day 1: Introduction to Python

Introduction to Python and its importance in data science

Installing Python and an integrated development environment (IDE)

Basic Python syntax: variables, data types, arithmetic operations

Task: Write a Python program to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

# Day 2: Working with Data in Python

Introduction to data types: strings, integers, floats, and booleans

Lists: creating, indexing, slicing, and basic operations

Task: Write a Python program to create a list of numbers, calculate the sum of the list, and find the maximum and minimum values.

# Day 3: Data Cleaning and Visualization

Handling missing data: identifying and filling missing values

Removing duplicates and outliers from data

Task: Load a CSV file using Pandas, identify and fill missing values, remove duplicates, and plot a histogram of a numeric column.

# Day 4: Introduction to Data Analysis

Understanding the importance of data analysis in real-world applications

Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, and standard deviation

Task: Analyze a dataset using Pandas, calculate the mean and median of a numerical column, and find the mode of a categorical column.

# Day 5: Introduction to Pandas

Introduction to Pandas library for data manipulation

Data filtering, sorting, and grouping using Pandas

# Day 6: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Introduction to Matplotlib library for data visualization

Creating line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts

Task: Plot a line chart showing the trend of a numerical variable over time and create a bar chart to compare the values of different categories.

# Day 7: Introduction to NumPy

Introduction to NumPy library for numerical computations

Array creation, indexing, and basic operations

Task: Create a NumPy array, perform basic arithmetic operations, and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the array.
